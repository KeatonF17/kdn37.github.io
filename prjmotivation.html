The motivation behind this idea is that there are numerous times where I’m thinking about what I should make for dinner or what I should cook for lunch but I have a restriction of what food is in the house or what particular taste I feel like, for example if I feel like something with tomatoes but I’m not sure what I could just put tomatoes into the app and a protein source and then it would spit out a list of meals to make.
