<div style=margin:40px>
	<p>Changpeng Zhao, is the founder of and runs Binance, one of the worlds most popular Crypto Currency trading platforms in the world. He is an active social media influencer, predominately on Twitter and is regarded as a centric figure in the blockchain and crypto currency industry. <br><br>Part of his view as CEO, and the key driver of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is the decentralised aspect of the industry – is that there is a need for a centralised exchange, which is what Binance is. His belief is because there needs to be a way for the flow of money towards a cryptocurrency by means of using traditional currency, alas fiat.<br><br>
	Given the nature of the workplace has evolved, particularly due to COVID his belief is that productive and meaningful work can be done not necessarily at an office or a company’s headquarters but remotely from home or anywhere in the world.<br><br><!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9F9_pzVG7w--></p>
<strong>Q: What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</strong><br>
<p>In terms of the company, they employ thousands of people to provide the customer service that ought to be expected for a company that services over 90 million users. This is facilitated mainly using infrastructure dedicated in the IT spectrum, from social media channels like Twitter and instant messaging platforms such as Telegram.</p>
<strong>Q: What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong><br>
<p>Answer</p>
<strong>Q: Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong><br>
<p>As CZ discusses the accessibility of work from home as if work that can be done from home or remotely it is reasonable to assume he works in this same method.****extend</p>
<strong>Q: What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong><br>
	<p>The challenging part of their role operating a popular cryptocurrency exchange is catering to the expectations of their community – as the frequent request to listing a certain project holds the prospective customer’s motive to make a significant financial gain whereas Binance’s core values are about the quality of the project, and given the volume of projects and tokens that are created, only 0.01% of projects actually end up being listed on the exchange, on top of the challenges with catering to the interests of its customers, more serious challenges face Changpeng Zhao and Binance are regulations. The definition of what whether cryptocurrencies can be determined as a security by the SEC has really hampered the industry in a scope to really class it as what some call a ponzi scheme, and to move away from that stigma. Considering that anyone can mint a token on the Binance Smart Chain damages the legitimacy of any project and it asks the question if it’s because of this reputation of “less than desirable coins” being easily accessible and created on its network, does this damage its seriousness of an institution?</p></div>
