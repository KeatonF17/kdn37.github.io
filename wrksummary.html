<div style=margin:40px>
	<p>Changpeng Zhao, is the founder of and runs Binance, one of the worlds most popular Crypto Currency trading platforms in the world. He is an active social media influencer, predominately on Twitter and is regarded as a centric figure in the blockchain and crypto currency industry. <br><br>Part of his view as CEO, and the key driver of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is the decentralised aspect of the industry – is that there is a need for a centralised exchange, which is what Binance is. His belief is because there needs to be a way for the flow of money towards a cryptocurrency by means of using traditional currency, alas fiat.<br><br>
	Given the nature of the workplace has evolved, particularly due to COVID his belief is that productive and meaningful work can be done not necessarily at an office or a company’s headquarters but remotely from home or anywhere in the world.<br><br><!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9F9_pzVG7w--></p>
