<div style=margin:40px><p>My name is Sean Heighway, I’m 27 years old and since graduating high school in 2012 I’ve been working full time in the hospitality and management sectors. I’ve always had a keen interest in all things technology whether it be video games or even just the components used to build and run a computer.

I come from an all Australian only english speaking family, we are a small but close family who love getting together and celebrating all family milestones and special events throughout the year. As far as my education goes I completed my high school certificate in 2012 and since then have completed a couple of units in a bachelor of nutrition before changing to this IT course to follow my true interests. I love all things cricket and have been playing with the same group of friends for the last 10 years in our local competition and just can’t get enough of it whether it be watching the games on tv or playing every saturday in summer.
<br>
My interest in IT came from a very young age from when I was about 6 years old I remember playing on a very old computer with my dad playing the first Warcraft game that was released and ever since then I’ve had an enormous interest in video games, how they work and how I can get involved in the creating of games. I would say my primary interest in IT is in the gaming sector of it however since learning about python and how to work and code in python I can say that I find it very interesting and satisfying to write a code and see it come to life!

I chose RMIT because one of my friends recommended them to me and after doing some research I see that it has an awesome reputation and can provide me with everything I need to succeed in a career in IT.

I expect to learn a lot about IT in particular coding and programming using different languages and how to use that to develop projects such as maybe games and fix real world problems.
