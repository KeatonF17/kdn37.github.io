Right now, I’m not one hundred percent certain what my ideal job will be. A potential ideal job is a game developer. More specially a programmer for games development. A job as a game developer is appealing as I’ve been playing games for a long time, and it is something I’m passionate about. I think I would really enjoy being a developer creating my own games and experiences.
As shown in the job listing above Higher education is required in a related degree such as Software Engineering, Computer Science etc. The main skill required for this is to have good programming skills with C++. The job also requires experience with Unreal game development.
Currently I do not have any skills relative to this job as I have only just started my degree.
I plan to get the skills for this job by completing my degree. I plan on choosing electives focused on programming and game development. I also would look doing an internship at a game development studio to get vital experience and make connections.

<p>This job is responsible for the high quality encounter design of raid and dungeon content within the game world of warcraft; including things such as creative design, technical implementation, and careful attention to details such as balance and polish. A requirement for this job is a minimum of 3 years of game development experience and two years of content creation.
This job is appealing for me as for a long time during my life I have played this game at a very high level and have a deep connection to the game, I always used to think of ideas to myself of what I could do in a role like this to challenge myself as someone who plays the game in new and unique ways.

At the moment I am a long way off this goal but I believe in time with a lot of hard work I can get towards this goal, I just need a deeper understanding of game development and programming which is something that I am hoping I can develop in my time in this degree.

To get to this point I am going to try and master python as a coding language so that I can get to the point of being able to code in for games and also continue to play games to keep the imagination alive and fresh as well as the passion for gaming as I believe that is crucial for a role like that.</p>

Ideal Job
A role with a game development firm is a career I would be aspiring to. Upon researching roles I came across a senior Unity 3D developer for Block Ape Scissors located in Brisbane, albeit a remote tole. The role itself is related to game development in the blockchain landscape which is also an area of interest of mine. My understanding of the work to be performed in the role is to have the capability to contribute to the development of a digital 3D space for their game 'Block Ape Scissors' which is a stylised 'rock, paper and scissors game' that interacts with blockchain assets and landscapes, with programming these to intertwine together and as suspected be part of a "metaverse", which Block Ape Scissors has called the "Earniverse".
