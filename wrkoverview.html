		<br><br>To address our understanding of the industry at work, we decided as a group to report on the accounts by a select few IT progessionals as this provides the understanding from multiple perspectives the way the industry carries out their work. Additionaly to supplement the primary report, we have included an interview conducted with an IT professional that has many years of experience in the industry and demonstrates their contribution to their employer in a software and internet related service environment.
