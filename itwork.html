    <p><strong>Marking Rubric:</strong><br>You have clearly described the kind of work done. You have described and explored all of the interactions with other people. You have described how most time is spent with a high standard of narrative flow. You have succinctly included the challenging aspects of this work. Developing a section substantially beyond the question set.</p></div>
<br>The IT industry is large, varied and changes over time. It also easy to get a misleading impression of what is typically involved on a day-to-day basis from a job advertisement or a position description. In order to help you understand this, the best way seems to be to hear from some IT professionals about their daily work. There are two ways in which you can do this, as below.
<div style="margin:50px;">
  <h2 class="title2">Interview with IT Professional #1</h2>
 <p>As part of my role I design Pensions Administration Software processes which are built by a developer. I will then test these in a UAT environment to ensure the design is accurate, does not cause errors within the system, and is suitable for use by Admin colleagues. My team also maintains a Sharepoint site which contains documentation and training material to support our processes and wider pensions knowledge.</p>
<p>I work in the Third Party Pensions Administration industry in the UK. Rather than operating an in-house pension scheme for employees or private individuals, my firm provides admin, consulting and actuarial services to the trustees of occupational pension schemes. It is our role to provide these services on behalf of our clients in line with current pensions legislation, contractually agreed terms, and the relevant scheme’s own trust deed and rules. </p>
<p>As well as designing and maintaining day-to-day admin processes, I provide training to Admin colleagues and technical support on complex areas of pensions legislation.</p>
<p>My main customer is my firm’s Admin Team. I work closely with Admin colleagues and Team Managers in the UK, Poland and India to understand their needs and communicate process changes and improvements. I also work with our Customer Centre so that colleagues providing first line support by phone can communicate our processes to pension scheme members in easy-to-understand terms. I work very closely with technical experts from the Consulting Business and Law to ensure that the business is interpreting pensions law correctly, so I can translate legislation and regulations into practical processes. As mentioned previously, I design process for the Business Systems team who build these processes into our Admin software, and I will test that these processes are working as intended.</p>
<p>Business Systems is the team of software developers I work closely with. They roll out updates from our software vendor, as well as building the processes designed by my team, maintaining background factors and tables used in the calculation of pension benefits, and implementing fixes where issues are reported by Admin colleagues. On occasion I will meet with representatives from the software vendor to discuss solutions and improvements to the base software package they supply us with – we do run into limitations when designing processes, particularly when new legislation necessitates the addition of background tables or routines which Business Systems is unable to implement.</p>
<p>I provide copy for client-facing communications which will be provided to clients by our client managers. These communications usually focus on improvements and changes we’re making to our processes, especially when the UK Government introduces new pensions legislation. Trustees of pension schemes want to be reassured that our service remains legally compliant. My role here is to explain the changes in non-software, client-friendly terminology. Where the changes result in an increase in overall effort, it is also my role to quantify that effort in terms of time spent and an appropriate fee.</p>
<p>Designing processes and writing up admin-facing documentation to support these processes takes up most of my time.</p>
<p>The most challenging aspect is distilling complex legislation into an easy-to-use, practical process. Sometimes the legislation is unclear or requires multiple steps and loops within a single process, especially when transferring a member’s pension from one scheme to another. Early builds of new transfer processes have extended to hundreds of clicks between a member requesting a transfer and my firm paying it to the member’s chosen scheme. The challenge is then to reduce the number of clicks as much as possible while still complying with the regulations.</p>
<p>The goal of the IT industry is to make lives easier. Technology solutions can take processes, both simple and complex, and provide a degree of automation to reduce the time spent while producing the same output. I attend a quarterly process improvement forum with Business Systems and Admin representatives where we table ideas to automate aspects of our firm’s processes; we take the ideas with the most time and cost benefit, design and implement these.</p></div>
<br>• Interview an IT professional
<br>• View, summarise and discuss at least 10 YouTube videos or other web sources (you may be surprised how many hits there are for a Google search on A day in the life of an IT professional).
<br>You as a group need to choose one of these two approaches. If it all possible, it is strongly recommended that you (as a group) interview an IT professional. Not only will this information be more direct, it may provide you with a contact that you will find helpful in the future. If you choose this option, you will find on the Assignment 2 page on Canvas a list of questions to ask as a starting point and some basic training in how to go about this interview.
<br>Include raw transcripts / recordings in appendix to support your written component.
<br>If you choose the web sources option, you need to report on 5 different IT professionals, as well as indicate your 10 sources.
<br>Whichever source of information you use, you should answer the following questions.
<br>• What kind of work is done by the IT professional?
<br><strong>• What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong><br>
  <br><strong>• Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong><br>
  One of the IT professionals I spoke to generally spends majority of their time working from home, part in due to the Covid pandemic but also the company they work for did not renew the lease of their office space, making on-site work unfeasible and saving on overheads, where employees benefitted by receiving a pay rise as well as the versatility of working their own schedule. - Nelson 
<br>  • What aspect of their position is most challenging?</div>
