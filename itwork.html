    <p><strong>Marking Rubric:</strong><br>You have clearly described the kind of work done. You have described and explored all of the interactions with other people. You have described how most time is spent with a high standard of narrative flow. You have succinctly included the challenging aspects of this work. Developing a section substantially beyond the question set.</p></div>
<br>The IT industry is large, varied and changes over time. It also easy to get a misleading impression of what is typically involved on a day-to-day basis from a job advertisement or a position description. In order to help you understand this, the best way seems to be to hear from some IT professionals about their daily work. There are two ways in which you can do this, as below.
<br>• Interview an IT professional
<br>• View, summarise and discuss at least 10 YouTube videos or other web sources (you may be surprised how many hits there are for a Google search on A day in the life of an IT professional).
<br>You as a group need to choose one of these two approaches. If it all possible, it is strongly recommended that you (as a group) interview an IT professional. Not only will this information be more direct, it may provide you with a contact that you will find helpful in the future. If you choose this option, you will find on the Assignment 2 page on Canvas a list of questions to ask as a starting point and some basic training in how to go about this interview.
<br>Include raw transcripts / recordings in appendix to support your written component.
<br>If you choose the web sources option, you need to report on 5 different IT professionals, as well as indicate your 10 sources.
<br>Whichever source of information you use, you should answer the following questions.
<br>• What kind of work is done by the IT professional?
<br><strong>• What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</strong><br>
  <br><strong>• Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong><br>
  One of the IT professionals I spoke to generally spends majority of their time working from home, part in due to the Covid pandemic but also the company they work for did not renew the lease of their office space, making on-site work unfeasible and saving on overheads, where employees benefitted by receiving a pay rise as well as the versatility of working their own schedule. - Nelson 
<br>  • What aspect of their position is most challenging?</div>
