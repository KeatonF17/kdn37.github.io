<div style=margin:40px><p><h2>What does it do?</h2>
Blockchain technology can be classified as a database that records information that is unable to be changed, hacked or cheated. (Reference) It is viewed as a digital ledger for transactions carried out by many cryptocurrencies, which are a form of digital currency used in place of traditional forms of currency. Cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a highly speculative, high risk investment and has had the stigma associated with online black markets and criminal organisations since Bitcoin’s inception, which its initial release was early 2009.
<br><br>
As time progresses, more transactions are carried out on the blockchain, requiring more complex algorithms to be computed by a network of systems, which cryptocurrency users refer to as “mining”. Mining cryptocurrencies require computing power that would traditionally be provided by individual users, but as the processing requirements become more complicated to validate the transactions to the blockchain, the work has become partitioned to numerous contributors.</p></div>

<div style=margin:40px><p><h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
Just like digital disruption began with the dot com boom, with small businesses dying out because they didn’t have a website, the same could be said for businesses that don’t adopt to the blockchain. As more and more adoption occurs, there will be more people looking to spend their cryptocurrency and the benefit of blockchain technology provides impeccable record keeping (Brown, 2022). It can be argued that cryptocurrencies and blockchain will affect any person that deals with buying and selling and that doesn’t leave anyone out globally.
<br><br>
If goods and services were priced on the current denomination of 1 Bitcoin = $53,176 AUD whereas one month ago it was priced at $51,829, I would have more buying power than I would 30 days ago. Does this take into account current issues faced with the global economy, such as inflation and the flow on effects of the international and national supply chain, would those be priced in the price of the Bitcoin I would spend at Coles? Or would it be how we treat traditional currency conversion alas from AUD to USD, where the buying power differs in low amounts of cents but add up as the value goes higher. These are still questions being asked, even where it comes to the SEC in the United States have an infamous court case against Ripple and to determine whether their cryptocurrency platform is classed a security. Hypothetically, if the world economy was dominated by a single cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, a truly decentralised trading economy would be of benefit to society as issues such as inflation could be a thing of the past (Huang, 2020).
<br><br>
It’s disruption will cause the traditional banking sector to change as adoption grows.

As mining cryptocurrencies increase, the resources required for providing state of the art infrastructure will affect other indsutries, as we have seen with the semiconductor shortage, also in part due to the covid 19 pandemic, where computer parts have been produced more in frequency and taken more of those resources, away from industries such as automotive with the production of contemporary vehicles, the gaming industry with PS5, Xbox series S/X.</p></div>

<div style=margin:40px><p><h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?
The way blockchain and cryptocurrencies would affect my everyday life is how I would transact for goods and services.
