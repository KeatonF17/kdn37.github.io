<div style=margin:40px><p><h2>Overview</h2>
As a group, the member sof Thirty Seven Gang elected to choose four technologies to present a report on. The technologies chosen represent individual choice, interest and the way they're rapidly evolving within the indsutry.
<br><br>
	For these reasons we chose <a href="../../../Documents/Unnamed Site 2/blockchain.html">Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies</a>, <a href="../../../Documents/Unnamed Site 2/cybersecurity.html">Cyber Security</a>, <a href="../../../Documents/Unnamed Site 2/machinelearning.html">Machine Learning</a>, and <a href="../../../Documents/Unnamed Site 2/robotics.html">Robotics</a>. 
<br><br>
Where blockchain and cryptocurrencies go in the future is anyone’s guess, as the scalability in projects that are available to consumers have exploded due to the increased interest of the technology – and this is partly due to the financial reward and not what the technology offers. There are paired utilities that when Bitcoin came into being wasn’t realised even recently in 2017 when non-fungible tokens, also known as NFTs, arrived onto the scene. The first prominent NFT project that came to life were the CryptoPunks on the Ethereum blockchain. It was designed to celebrate the punk rock lifestyle, as a collection of ten thousand images that shared a similar design style but they were all unique and can be easily described as a digital collectible, and in sense is where evidence of physical assets can be stored, such as a certificate of title of a property or something as basic as a receipt for buying a cup of coffee. It’s been hypothesised that there will be a time where the traditional stock market will be succeeded by a blockchain stock market, where the authentication of transactions with buying, selling would negate the need of having a central authority brokering buy and sell orders, as was seen when Robinhood, a centalised brokerage platform, stopped buy and sell orders of the shares for GameStop early last year, prompting an outcry and embarrassing public ridicule of Wall St.
<br><br>
The way blockchain, cryptocurrencies and NFTs are processed today may be different in a decade’s time. As the way we generally view computers would be referred to as classic computing, where a task is carried out in what we perceive as a reasonable timeframe on the most current and up to date graphics card, quantum computing may make those tasks complete where no time has passed or negate the need for such tasks to be done in the first place. The beautiful thing about this technology is that its intended use is to provide a truly autonomous, decentralised form of doing business, where there are no outside interference that have ulterior financial motives and the way that is ought to be achieved can’t be determined based on the way technology evolves at any pace.
